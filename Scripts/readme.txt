These are code scripts for running some of the analyses in our paper "Statistical Complexity of Heterogeneous Geometric Networks", published in PLOS Complex Systems in 2024. They make use of custom functions in the "Functions" folder as well as a thresholding function from the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) which you will need to have in your MATLAB file path in order to run. If you run into any issues, please contact me by email at keith.m.smith@strath.ac.uk.
